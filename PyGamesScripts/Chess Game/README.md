# Chess Game
### This repo contains program for a Chess Game in python.

#### In this game, the whole board can be controlled using simple algebraic commands, 
For example:
>>>e4 e7
This will move the pawn present on the e4 position to the e7 position. The program will evaluate constantly, whether its a valid move or not.  

General Chess Rules
White is always first to move and players take turns alternately moving one piece at a time. A piece may be moved to another position or may capture an opponent´s piece, replacing on its square. With the exception of the knight, a piece may not move over or through any of the other pieces. When a king is threatened with capture (but can protect himself or escape), it´s called check. If a king is in check, then the player must make a move that eliminates the threat of capture and cannot leave the king in check. Checkmate happens when a king is placed in check and there is no legal/valid move to escape. Checkmate ends the game and the side whose king was checkmated looses.
